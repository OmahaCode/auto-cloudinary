# Cloudinary Auto-Upload for WordPress

This plugin provides a super simple [Cloudinary auto-upload](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/fetch_remote_images#auto_upload_remote_resources) implementation for WordPress.

Cloudinary will **automatically fetch and serve the images** from your media library, without you having to worry about the complicated fetch API! Just [set up auto-upload](https://github.com/junaidbhura/auto-cloudinary/wiki/Setup) in your Cloudinary settings, enter the details in the plugin's options, and you're all set!

Easy peasy ðŸ˜Ž

## What does this plugin do?

This plugin does two main things:

1. Provides a simple function `cloudinary_url()` to get a Cloudinary auto-upload URL for any image in your media library, with all the Cloudinary transformations, so you can **dynamically manipulate an image on the fly**.
1. Attempts to automatically convert all image URLs on the front-end into a Cloudinary auto-upload URL, so you can **use Cloudinary as an image CDN**.

## The magical function ðŸŽ©
